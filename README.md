- Two categories (A&B) of ten stimuli each (from Modern Art - already have data validating them) 
 
- Two stimuli are randomly selected for each participant (targets)

- All stimuli are presented (1 at a time) for categorization 
   * randomly shift the image right/left, up/down by 10 pixels 
   * randomly change the overall size by +/-5%
   *This helps prevent pixel matching across trials

- Response window limited to 10s, feedback for 300ms
 
- across the experiment (or within a block) we have a few repetitions of A1-9 & B1-9, with many repetitions of A10 & B10:

## Example: 

     - each block has 36 trials:

          - A1-9 (no repetitions --> 9 trials)

          - B1-9 (no repetitions --> 9 trials)
          - A10 (9 repetitions --> 9 trials)

          - B10 (9 repetitions --> 9 trials)

     - 5 blocks produces a total of 180 trials (45 repetitions of targets)

     * no consecutive identical trials
